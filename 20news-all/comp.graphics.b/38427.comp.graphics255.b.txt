   method find center circle defined set  point intersecting normal define  circle center small numerical imprecision  line intersect supposedly plane intersect unique  point parallel    thought don project line  plane formed line intersection calculation plane  guaranteed unique solution parallel  won happen case parametric distance line  circle centre determine exact point interest  bypass messy error propogation required calculation   hope haven foot   steve
