   ago started work problem appeared  simple turned difficult wondering  net problem hopefully published  solution   problem draw outline surface defined  roughly parallel cubic spline input problem essentially  start set point set point  edge object treat dimensional extant  edge exist dimensional space draw  object   fit cubic spline point spline effectively  sequence line segment approximating  curve spline equal number segment assume  nth segment spline roughly  distance spline reasonable   segment spline match nth segment  opposing spline pair segment form  filled color surface  depth sort triangle  triangle sorted order project pixmap draw  color triangle edge triangle  edge surface draw line edge  special edge color   edge coloring step heart  problem idea effectively outline edge surface  net result generally lot break gap  edge surface reason fairly complicated  involve rasterization problem problem resulting  projecting spline problem  sound familiar appreciate knowing work  area   thanks
